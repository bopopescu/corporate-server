 Either external modules are available as debian packages, in which case
 they are removed; or they are not good candidates for being packaged
 at the moment, in which case they are kept.

 The Artistic License 2.0
 .
 Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl Foundation.
 .
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 .
 Preamble
 .
 This license establishes the terms under which a given free software
 Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed.
 The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic
 control over the development of that Package while still keeping the
 Package available as open source and free software.
 .
 You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this
 license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package.  If the
 terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to
 make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek
 a different licensing arrangement.
 .
 Definitions
 .
     "Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s)
     named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.
 .
     "Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other
     material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's
     procedures.
 .
     "You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy,
     distribute, or modify the Package.
 .
     "Package" means the collection of files distributed by the
     Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of
     those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard
     Version, or a Modified Version.
 .
     "Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it
     accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or
     organization, to others outside of your company or organization.
 .
     "Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing
     this Package or providing support for this Package to another
     party.  It does not mean licensing fees.
 .
     "Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been
     modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested
     by the Copyright Holder.
 .
     "Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and
     such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright
     Holder.
 .
     "Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with
     the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as
     it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.
 .
     "Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and
     configuration files for the Package.
 .
     "Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary,
     or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or
     translation of the Source form.
 .
 .
 Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution
 .
 (1)  You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use
 Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that
 you do not Distribute the Modified Version.
 .
 .
 Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version
 .
 (2)  You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the
 Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,
 either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate
 all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.  At
 your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a
 Compiled form of the Package.
 .
 (3)  You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other
 modifications made available from the Copyright Holder.  The resulting
 Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such
 will be subject to the Original License.
 .
 .
 Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source
 .
 (4)  You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis
 or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the
 Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs
 from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting
 any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that
 you do at least ONE of the following:
 .
     (a)  make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder
     of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the
     Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard
     Version.
 .
     (b)  ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not
     prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In
     addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different
     from the name of the Standard Version.
 .
     (c)  allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to
     make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others
     under
 .
         (i)  the Original License or
 .
         (ii)  a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,
         modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same
         licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee
         received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified
         Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely
         available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor
         Fees are allowed.
 .
 .
 Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version
 or Modified Versions without the Source
 .
 (5)  You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without
 the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to
 get the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be
 valid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any
 time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you
 must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.
 If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty
 days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then
 you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.
 .
 (6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without
 the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to
 the Source of the Modified Version.
 .
 .
 Aggregating or Linking the Package
 .
 (7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or
 Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting
 aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the
 Package.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other
 components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license
 apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions
 as included in the aggregation.
 .
 (8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with
 other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to
 build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that
 include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,
 provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.
 .
 .
 Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version
 .
 (9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that
 merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause
 the Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not
 considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the
 terms of this license.
 .
 .
 General Provisions
 .
 (10)  Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or
 Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,
 modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not
 use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this
 license.
 .
 (11)  If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified
 Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required
 to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of
 this license.
 .
 (12)  This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,
 service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.
 .
 (13)  This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,
 free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
 sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any
 patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily
 infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation
 (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging
 that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent
 infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the
 date that such litigation is filed.
 .
