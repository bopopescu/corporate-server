<section id="print-services:Introduction">
<title>Introduction</title>
	<para>
		&ucsUCS; includes a print system, which can also be used to realize
		complex environments. Printers and printer groups can be created and
		configured conveniently in &ucsUMC;. Extensions for cost
		calculation and page limitation can be installed subsequently using
		the print quota system.
	</para>
	<para>
		The print services are based on <emphasis>CUPS (Common Unix Printing
		System)</emphasis>. <emphasis>CUPS</emphasis> manages print jobs in print queues and
		converts print jobs into the native formats of the connected printers.
		The print queues are also administrated in &ucsUMC;, see
		<xref linkend="umc:modules:printer"/>.
	</para>
	<para>
		All printers set up in CUPS can be directly used by UCS systems and
		are automatically also provided for Windows computers when Samba is
		used.
	</para>
	<para>
		The technical capacities of a printer are specified in so-called PPD
		files. These files include for example whether a printer can print in
		color, whether duplex printing is possible, whether there are several
		paper trays, which resolutions are supported and which printer control
		languages are supported (e.g., PCL or PostScript).
	</para>
	<para>
		Print jobs are transformed by CUPS with the help of filters into a
		format that the respective printer can interpret, for example into
		PostScript for a PostScript-compatible printer.
	</para>
	<para>
		UCS already includes a wide variety of filters and PPD
		files. Consequently, most printers can be employed without the need to
		install additional drivers. The setting up of additional PPD files is
		described in <xref linkend="print::ppdlisten"/>.
	</para>
	<para>
		A printer can either be connected directly to the print server
		locally (e.g., via the USB port or a parallel port) or communicate
		with a printer via remote protocols (e.g., TCP/IP compatible printers,
		which are connected via <systemitem class="protocol">IPP</systemitem> or <systemitem class="protocol">LPD</systemitem>).
	</para>
	<para>
		Network printers with their own IP address should be registered in the
		computer administration of &ucsUMC; as an IP managed client (see
		<xref linkend="systemrollen"/>).
	</para>
	<para>
		CUPS offers the possibility of defining printer groups. The included
		printers are used employed alternating, which allows automatic load
		distribution between neighboring printers.
	</para>
	<para>
		The print quota system, which can be installed using
		the <package>univention-printquota</package> package, can be used to install an
		expansion for recording incurred printer costs and for limiting the
		number of pages to be printed. The setting and configuration is documented in the extended
		documentation <biblioref linkend="ext-print-doc"/>.
	</para>
	<para>
		Print shares from Windows systems can also be integrated in the CUPS
		print server, see <xref linkend="print::shares"/>.
	</para>

<section id="print-services:Installing_a_print_server">
  <title>Installing a print server</title>
  <para>
	A printserver can be installed from the Univention App Center with the application
	<emphasis>Print server (CUPS)</emphasis>. Alternatively, the software package
	<package>univention-printserver</package> can be installed
	(<command>univention-run-join-scripts</command> must be executed after installation).
	Additional information can be found in <xref
	linkend="computers::softwaremanagement::installsoftware"/>.
  </para>
</section>

<section id="print-services:configuration">
  <title>Setting the local configuration properties of a print server</title>
  <para>
	The configuration of the CUPS print server is performed via settings from the LDAP directory
	service and &ucsUCR;. If the &ucsUCRV; <envar>cups/include/local</envar> is set to
	<literal>true</literal>, the <filename>/etc/cups/cupsd.local.conf</filename> file is included,
	in which arbitrary options can be defined. Changes in this file require <command>ucr commit /etc/cups/cupsd.conf</command> to get applied.
  </para>

  <para>
	If an error occurs when working through a printer queue (e.g., because the connected printer is
	switched off), the further processing of the queue is stopped in the default setting. This must
	then be reactivated by the administrator (see <xref linkend="umc:modules:printer"/>). If the
	&ucsUCRV; <envar>cups/errorpolicy</envar> is set to <emphasis>retry-job</emphasis>, CUPS
	automatically attempts to process unsuccessful print jobs again every 30 seconds.
  </para>

<section id="print::shares">
<title>Creating a printer share</title>
	<para>
		Print shares are administrated in the UMC module <emphasis>Printers</emphasis>
		with the <guimenu>Printer share</guimenu> object type
		(see <xref linkend="central:user-interface"/>).

		<graphic scalefit="1" width="90%" align="center" fileref="illustrations44/create_printershare_en.png"/>
	</figure>
	<para>
		When adding/deleting/editing a printer share, the printer is
		automatically configured in CUPS. CUPS does not have an LDAP interface
		for printer configuration, instead the <filename>printers.conf</filename> file is
		generated via a listener module. If Samba is used, the printer
		shares are also automatically provided for Windows clients.

  <para>
	Printer shares are usually operated using the Windows printer drivers
	provided. The network printer can alternatively be set up on the
	Windows side with a standard PostScript printer driver. If a color

					The drivers for the different Windows architectures can be uploaded one after the other or together.
					If both driver architectures are selected for uploading at the same time, the 64-bit driver should be selected first in the subsequent file selection window.
					Once Windows has uploaded these files to the server, it asks for the location of the 32-bit drivers again.

					If the printer driver in question is being assigned to a printer for the first time, a dialogue window is shown, asking whether the printer can be trusted.
					This should be confirmed with <guimenu>Install driver</guimenu>.
					The printer drivers saved on the server side are now downloaded to the client.
					If the printer driver in question has already been downloaded to the Windows system in question in this manner before, Windows displays an error message at this point <literal>0x0000007a</literal>.

					Important: Now, instead of clicking directly on <guimenu>OK</guimenu>, you need to return to the <guimenu>General</guimenu> tab again.
					The old name for the printer share should still be displayed on the tab.
					In UCS releases earlier than UCS 4.0-1, it is possible that the Windows system has changed the name of the printer share to the name of the printer driver.
					If that were accepted, the printer would no longer be associated with the share!
					If this is the case, the name of the printer on the <guimenu>General</guimenu> tab (the first input field next to the stylized printer symbol) needs to be reset to the name of the print share.
					This can be done using the <guimenu>Samba name</guimenu> field configured in the print management of the UMC (or if this was left blank, use the value from <guimenu>Name</guimenu>).
					If the name has had to be reset in this fashion, Windows then asks if you are sure that you want to change the name when <guimenu>OK</guimenu> is clicked.
					Confirm the prompt.
			</simpara></listitem>

			<listitem><simpara>
					To give the Windows printer driver the opportunity to save correct standard settings for the printer, you now need to switch to the <guimenu>Device settings</guimenu> tab.
					The name of the tab differs from manufacturer to manufacturer and may also be <guimenu>Settings</guimenu> or even just <guimenu>Configuration</guimenu>.
					Clicking on <guimenu>OK</guimenu> closes the window.
					You can then print a test page.
					If Windows displays an error message here <literal>0x00000006</literal>, the printer settings must be checked again to see whether there is a manufacturer-specific tab called <guimenu>Device settings</guimenu> (or something similar).
					If so, it should be opened and then simply confirmed with <guimenu>OK</guimenu>.
					This closes the dialogue window and saves the printer drivers settings (<literal>PrinterDriverData</literal>)in the Samba registry.

					At this point, it is also practical to make the settings for the paper size and other parameters, so that they are saved in the print share.
					Other Windows systems which subsequently access the print share will then find the correct settings automatically.
					These settings can usually be opened by clicking on the <guimenu>Standard values...</guimenu> button in the <guimenu>Advanced</guimenu> tab of the printer settings.
					The dialogue window which opens also varies from manufacturer to manufacturer.
					Typically, the settings for paper size and orientation are found on a tab called <guimenu>Page set-up</guimenu> or <guimenu>Paper/Quality</guimenu>.
					Once the dialogue has been confirmed by clicking on <guimenu>OK</guimenu>, the printer driver saves these settings (as <literal>Default DevMode</literal>) for the printer in the Samba registry.

<title>Integrating additional PPD files</title>
	<para>
		The technical capacities of a printer are specified in so-called PPD
		files. These files include for example whether a printer can print in
		color, whether duplex printing is possible, whether there are several
		paper trays, which resolutions are supported and which printer control
		languages are supported (e.g., PCL or PostScript).
	</para>
	<para>
		In addition to the PPD files already included in the standard scope,
		additional ones can be added via &ucsUMC;. The PPDs are generally
		provided by the printer manufacturer and need to be copied into
		the <filename class="directory">/usr/share/ppd/</filename> directory on the print servers.
	</para>
	<para>
		The printer driver lists are administrated in
		the UMC module <guimenu>LDAP directory</guimenu>. There you need
		to switch to the <uri>univention</uri> container and then to
		the <uri>cups</uri> subcontainer. Printer driver lists already exist
		for the majority of printer manufacturers. These can be expanded or
		new ones can be added.
