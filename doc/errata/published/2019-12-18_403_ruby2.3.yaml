fix: 2.3.3-1+deb9u7
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Ruby allows HTTP Response Splitting. If a program using WEBrick inserts
   untrusted input into the response header, an attacker can exploit it to
   insert a newline character to split a header, and inject malicious content
   to deceive clients. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix
   for CVE-2017-17742, which addressed the CRLF vector, but did not address an
   isolated CR or an isolated LF. (CVE-2019-16254)
 * Ruby mishandles path checking within File.fnmatch functions.
   (CVE-2019-15845)
 * Regular expression denial of service vulnerability of WEBrick's Digest
   access authentication (CVE-2019-16201)
 * Ruby allows code injection if the first argument (aka the "command"
   argument) to Shell#[] or Shell#test in lib/shell.rb is untrusted data. An
   attacker can exploit this to call an arbitrary Ruby method.
