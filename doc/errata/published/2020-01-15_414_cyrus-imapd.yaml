 This update addresses the following issue:
 * An issue was discovered in Cyrus IMAP. If sieve script uploading is allowed
   (3.x) or certain non-default sieve options are enabled (2.x), a user with a
   mail account on the service can use a sieve script containing a fileinto
   directive to create any mailbox with administrator privileges, because of
   folder mishandling in autosieve_createfolder() in imap/lmtp_sieve.c.
