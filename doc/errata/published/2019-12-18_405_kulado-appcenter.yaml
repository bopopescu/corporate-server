desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The startup performance of the UMC module has been improved.
   Listing all apps first shows the cached result of the previous query
   while a new query is being performed. When the new query is done
   the cache is updated and the result is shown in the browser.
 * A Promise was evaluated as resolved too early due to an missing
   return which caused standby animations to end too early. This has been
   addressed.
