fix: 2:4.10.1-1A~4.4.0.202001141239
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Samba not recognizing Unix-SIDs as valid caused crashes of the
   Microsoft Windows Explorer, when opening the security
   tab on a share or file where such SIDs are found in the ACLs.
   We found several other "well known" SIDs which could trigger a crash
   and declared them as valid in Samba.
 * The DRS replication of Samba/AD domain controllers didn't handle the
   inheritance of Active Directory Service (LDAP) ACLs properly.
   These ACLs are stored in the nTSecurityDescriptor LDAP attribute.
   In case an administrator explicitly changed Active Directory LDAP ACLs to
   delegate new rights to an account (user or group), or to restrict delegated
   rights, these changes would only automatically be inherited to all
   subobjects in the LDAP tree on the specific domain controller where the
   admin was working on. But on all other replicating domain controllers, the
   automatic inheritance did not take place correctly.
   To fix this for a particular Active Directory LDAP partition, a 'full-sync'
   DRS operation can be initiated manually.

 * If samba is run with "log level = 3" (or above) then the string
   obtained from the client, after a failed character conversion, is
   printed.  Such strings can be provided during the NTLMSSP
   authentication exchange. On the Samba/AD domain controller in particular,
   this may cause a long-lived process (such as the RPC server) to terminate.
   For more details and possible mitigations see
   <https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2019-14907.html>
 * Samba 4.9 introduced an off-by-default feature to tombstone
   dynamically created DNS records that had reached their expiry time.
   This feature is controlled by the smb.conf option:
          dns zone scavenging = yes
   which is not active by default in UCS. The scavenging code suffered from
   a use after free issue, a type of memory handling error that could lead
   to unexpected behavior.
