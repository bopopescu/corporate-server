Description: UCS - mount home directories from other servers
 This package mounts users' home directories from other
 servers upon login. The remote server will need to export
 the home directories via NFS, and the location of the home
 directories will need to be specified in the users' LDAP
 objects.
 .
 It is part of Univention Corporate Server (UCS), an
 integrated, directory driven solution for managing
 corporate environments. For more information about UCS,
