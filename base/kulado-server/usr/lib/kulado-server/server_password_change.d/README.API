server_password_change hook scripts

Scripts must have a name matching ^[A-Za-z0-9_-]+$ and be executable
Each script will be called (via run-parts) with parameter "prechange"
before the password is changed and then either with "nochange" if the
change failed, or "postchange" if the password was changed.  Old and
new passwords can be found in /etc/machine.secret.old and
/etc/machine.secret
