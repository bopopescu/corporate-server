This is the dummy package to be shipped with a UCS minor release.

For errata it will be created on-the-fly by repo/errata.py
As such the version number in "debian/changelog" must be below
"$MAJOR.$MINOR.$PATH-1"!

Do NOT bump the first number of the package version number on each minor
release, as this will break the above schema!
