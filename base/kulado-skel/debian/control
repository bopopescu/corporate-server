Description: UCS - user default configuration manager
 The univention-skel command installs skeleton files into
 the user's home directory. Different to the conventional
 approach to copy the files from /etc/skel when the home
 directory is created, univention-skel keeps track of the
 files it installed for the user and updates them as long
 as they are not modified.

 This package is part of Univention Corporate Server (UCS),
